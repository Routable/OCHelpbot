Feature TODO list:

COMMANDS:
# [ ] Allow custom commands to handle multiple returns (random quote lists)
         - This has been implemented in the "profquotes" command
         - Possible ways to do this are to have a special character seperating multiple returns and have the bot
           automatically identify it... such as a "@" or "^"
# [X] Quiz command
         - Ideally, this command would be robust enough to create quizzes, modify quizzes, start quizzes, and show quiz
           stats.
         - Answering quizzes could be in the form of reactions for multiple choice, or using a String comparator
# [ ] Addlink command
         - Could make "!links add" instead of new command.
# [ ] Music Player
# [X] Separate commands into 'cogs' (work in progress)
# [ ] Poll command - conduct polls using message reactions
# [ ] ImportantDates command (would be cool if it only gave upcoming events)
# [ ] More robust roll_dice command
          - Would be nice to be able to specify number of dice, number of sides and number of rolls and perhaps return
            probability
# [ ] Pi command - return pi to n digits
          - Currently in progress (having problems implementing the default Math library)
# [ ] Custom commands from discord
          - Copy flask custom command


FLASK:
# [ ] Have flask display Discord stats (such as top contributer, most upvoted etc.)
# [ ] Make a quiz form and have each quiz have its own url (eg '/quiz/<quizobject>'


Other Features:
# [X] Make bot 'autoreact' to certain words (such as prof names)
# [ ] Error catching for all SQL queries (currently nothing happens and it fails with no messaging)
# [ ] Welcome new users with embedded cool looking message
# [ ] Clean up code to remove all "userinput" strings and replace with proper arguments (eg '*, args')
# [ ] All SQL calls must be rewritten to prevent injection (Currently most of them use string building which is bad)
